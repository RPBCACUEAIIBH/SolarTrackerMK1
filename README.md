- The MK I circuit was designed for DIY-ers, with off the shelf modules and minimal custom circuit. (MK II will be more professional single board desing.) This 3 Sensor version requires even less components, less work, and thus it's more cost effective, and can be done with older arduinos where A6 and A7 not available.
- The program still lacks a couple of features, but seems to work fine.
- Instructions on how to set it right coming soon... For now ask on Discord!
